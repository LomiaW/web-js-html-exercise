            <h4>Cats Sleep Anywhere</h4>
            Cats sleep anywhere, any table, any chair.<br>
            Top of piano, window-ledge, in the middle, on the edge.<br>
            Open draw, empty shoe, anybody's lap will do.<br>
            Fitted in a cardboard box, in the cupboard with your frocks.<br>
            Anywhere! They don't care! Cats sleep anywhere.<br>
            <br>
